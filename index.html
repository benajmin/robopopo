				<h6>January 2015</h6>

				<p> This year a friend of mine started a Robot in 3 Days team at Waterloo. RI3D is a way for university students to participate in FRC: a highschool robotics competition. University teams build a robot for the same game as highschool students, but complete the build in 72 hours instead of 6 weeks. From the moment we know what the game is the clock starts.</p>
				
				<p> This year the game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZbdwYiCY74"> Power Up</a>, involved moving milk crates, lifting them up to 6 feet, and climbing onto a rung 7 feet off the ground. After a careful review af the rules and a general startegy discussion our teams broke off and we began discussing mechanisms. We quickly came up with a compliance wheel intake system but many system were proposed for placing power cubes on the scale. We discussed an arm, a telescoping elevator or a launcher but due to a lack of strong leadership we struggled to make any definite decisions. We broke off and started assembling components too early, before making any final design decisions and because of that ended up using an over complex combination elevator launcher system.</p>
				
				<p> Instead of sticking with what I know and working on software I decided to branch out to the manufacturing side of things in an attempt to learn as much as possible. I'm very happy with that decision as I found the entire weekend to be a incredibly unique and rewarding experience. I had the opportunity to work with some amazing people and learn so many new things. I used a drill press and a rivet gun for the first time, learned to solder larger components and learned basic design principles associated with box tube construction.</p>
				
				<p> While our robot was not as successful as I had hoped I'm still proud of what we accomplished. We were unable to put the power cubes on the 6 foot high switch, but after pulling an all nighter our robot was able to place the cubes on the scale and in the exchange as well as, most impressively, climb the rung</p>
				
				<p> While the event was msot certainly a success there was also room for improvement. I found that since we didn't meet until the week beforehand we missed out on a lot of possible preparation. In the future I would recommend more team building activities before hand as long as sessions to familiarize participants with the shop and tools available.</p>
